# Introduction

A non-profit organization that works with high schools across the United States helps students find their way in life. When the crucial time comes for these intelligent students to decide what they want to become, the organization provides them with the tools to help make that decision.

# Problem Statement

I have been assigned the lead analyst role to create an interactive dashboard in Excel that the organization can use to help students make this vital decision.

The data I will be analyzing contains U.S. Labor Statistics—yearly industry and state records by the number of employees and average annual wages. The data ranges from 2017 to 2020 across the United States. The Excel file I will be using contains 1,918 records over those four years.

The purpose of the dashboard is to provide the end users—the high school students—with a tool that will help them navigate the difficult path of selecting a career within the U.S. job landscape.

The dashboard needs to be easy to use without complicating the process. It should be visually pleasing, easy to understand, and include the correct selection of plots.

The student will select the industry they are interested in or find appealing and immediately see the average wages and how popular these industries are according to the state they want to live in.

# The Dashboard

The student will select which industry they are interested in at the top left of the dashboard, which will let them see:

1. Average Annual Wages
2. The share of employees in that industry as a percentage of all industries. For example, in the dashboard above, the Information industry's number of employees only makes up 2% of the total share.
3. Time-series data over the four years, showing how the industry trends based on average wages and the number of employees.

The interactivity of the dashboard is simplified for the user by using two adjustable options:

- Changing the industry type
- Selecting buttons to switch between average wages and the total number of employees per 1,000. The reason for using 'per 1,000' is to normalize results due to the differences in state populations; some states have far higher population numbers.


# Insights

Looking at the dashboard figure above, you can see that Washington and California have the highest average wages but some of the lowest shares of employees. The student can then assess whether they are prepared for the level of competition in the industry if they want those higher wages.

Education & Health, for example, has evenly spread average wages compared to the Information industry. Additionally, the number of workers in this industry is much higher.

Education & Health also shows positively trending average wages year after year.

Trade & Transportation has the highest share of employees but also some of the lowest average wages, with North Dakota housing most of the industry's employees.

## Conclusions

I have created an easy-to-use yet informative dashboard for the upcoming workforce. It is extremely useful for seeing which industry is the most popular, what the wages are for those industries, and how they perform year after year.

My recommendations for improving the data used would be to include sentiment data to see if those employees in the industry are satisfied with what they do, based on:

- Wages
- Quality of life
- Availability of jobs
